A brief description of each Python script is given below:
- [Phantom_Fittings.py](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralMethodsPaper/blob/main/CoralWeightTests/Phantom_Fittings.py)
- [WeightTest_DiagnosticFigures.py](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralMethodsPaper/blob/main/CoralWeightTests/WeightTest_DiagnosticFigures.py)
- [ResultsAggregator.py](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralMethodsPaper/blob/main/CoralWeightTests/ResultsAggregator.py)

## Directory structure

Make sure your ProjectRoot contains individualized folders for each scans with specific subdirectories as this ensures code runs smoothly and subsequent files are saved in the right places .
The ProjectRoot can be any folder under which single-scan folders are saved. 
See example below:

**Inside the scan folder, the following files can be found:**

- X-ray volume and reconstruction configuration files (respectively ***.raw***, ***.vgi*** and ***.xtekVolume*** extensions)
- a text file containing information about the specimen and additional volumetric measurements (***.VolMetrics*** extension)
- the histogram of the shrinkwraped masked volume (***.csv*** extension)
- the results from weight tests (***.xlsx*** extension) - created after running [Phantom_Fittings.py](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralMethodsPaper/blob/main/CoralWeightTests)
- diagnostic plots from calibration curves and respective weight tests (***.png*** extension) - created after running [WeightTest_DiagnosticFigures.py](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralMethodsPaper/blob/main/CoralWeightTests)

Additionally, scan folders should have secondary directories containing:

- a .tif image stack of the X-ray scan  (***'TIFF'***), which can be exported through AvizoÂ® or using Fiji/ImageJ.
- density standard extraction (***'STANDARD_EXTRACT'*** ). Refer to [PhantomExtraction](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralMethodsPaper/blob/main/PhantomExtraction) for more info


## Usage

Configure a python environment and install all necessary libraries/packages (see [requirements.txt](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralMethodsPaper/blob/main/requirements.txt)).
Make sure to run python code from terminal clients such as ***Windows PowerShell*** (code won't run from a Python Console in some platforms, due to multi-threading optimization). 

Specify your phython.exe from within your environment installation followed by the path to [Phantom_Fittings.py](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralMethodsPaper/blob/main/CoralWeightTests/Phantom_Fittings.py).

           <user> PythonEnvironment/path_to/python.ex CoralWeightTests/Phantom_Fittings.py

The code will run weight tests in parallel across the entire project tree for all scan folders. 
Runtime is ~60 min no matter how many scans are under a ProjectRoot (machine used had Intel Xeon 2.30 GHz 16-core CPU). 

This involves: 
- fitting different calibration curves using both linear, 3rd-degree polynomial, gaussian and exponential relationships across inserts from adopted phantom (11-point Extended or 6-point narrow) with their subvariations. 
- There's up to 32 calibration adjustments already parametrized in the code and this can be adapted. 
- reverse fitting each calibration curve (finding inverted functions) to obtain density estimates for each greyscale intensity present in a specimen's histogram
- calculate the specimen's total virtual weight per fit adjustment.
