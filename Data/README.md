Below is a brief description of files and subfolders in this directory.

[MP_CompleteDataset_SuppMat.xlsx](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralMethodsPaper/blob/main/Data/MP_CompleteDataset_SuppMat.xlsx) is a spreadsheet with :
 - X-ray µCT scans metadata for single and replicate scans
 - Calibration and weight test results for single and replicate scans
 - Calibration and weight test results for the crossover experiment (internal vs. external calibration)
 - Bulk correction results for replicate scans

**Units**:
- Weight Offsets : [\%]
- Weights : [g]
- Voxel size: [mm]
- Specimen volume : [cm<sup>3</sup>]
- SurfaceArea : [mm<sup>2</sup>]
- AreaOverVol: [cm<sup>-1</sup>]
- Density: [g cm<sup>-3</sup>]


[ROI_AnalysesBulkCorrection](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralMethodsPaper/blob/main/Data/ROI_AnalysesBulkCorrection) includes:
 - µCT X-ray images of replicate scans of 2 specimens situated at lower and upper end of colony density range (purple points in Fig.1A)
 - ImageJ/Figi zipped objects containing polygons that delimit selected low- and high-density regions of interest (ROIs), 
from which greyscale values were extracted and converted. (See tab "*5_ROI_DensityEstimates*" on
